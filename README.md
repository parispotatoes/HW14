Interactive Visualizations

For this assignment, a dataset of bellybutton microbiomes was used. Bootstrap 5, D3, and Plotly libraries were utilized to develop an interactive dashboard for visualizing the bellybutton biodiversity dataset. Bootstrap provided the layout and styling, D3 was employed to structure the webpage and manage data, and Plotly was used to generate dynamic charts for data exploration.
